Our group evaluated a data set that polled a population regarding their music listening habits and their self-reported levels of anxiety, depression
insomnia and OCD.

Given that this data set is about self-reported mental health, we must be careful when drawing any inferences or conclusions regarding the population. 
Thus, our group chose to frame our project and mindset as a research project. For the purpose of analysis, we imagined this poll was the first stage in
a series of evalutions to best understand our population and its relationship to mental health. Most importantly, for our final analysis, we're thinking
about how this data will shape the next steps in our research. 

e.g. What other questions would we want to ask to get a better understanding of a population? What data seems to have no statistical significnce and is it 
worth further inquiry? 

The questions we explored and their answers are as follows: 

1.	Is there a relationship between Rock Music and Metal Music and self-reported levels of mental illness?

From the data we found, we extrapolated that people who listen to both rock and metal have similar levels of depression, and OCD, which led us to conclude that both these genres can be considered to have an equal effect on people. We also found that people who listen to rock have higher levels of anxiety, compared to people who listen to metal who have higher levels of insomnia. An implicated hypothesis to consider would be that perhaps it is not a good idea to listen to metal before going to sleep.

2.	If there a positive relationship between classic music and self-reported levels of mental illness?

The data allowed us to conclude that the population who listens to classical music have overall lower levels of anxiety, depression, insomnia and OCD, compared to rock and metal. Given that the anxiety levels are among the lowest ones across all genres, one can formulate hypothesis stating that classical music can have positive effects in lowering anxiety levels on people.

3.	Is there any relationship between Rock music, Metal music, and Classical music and self-reported levels of mental illness?

In our Data Science Statistical Project we found that it seems in general, listening to classical music can be associated with lower levels of anxiety, depression and insomnia. Other genres like the aforementioned rock and metal were found to have higher levels on these areas. We also found that there didn't seem to be much correlation in terms of OCD and the distinct genres people listen to. This probably is because this is a disorder not directly related to negative mental health effects.

4.	What is the statistical relationship for the percent of the population who listen to music during work hours and self-reported levels of anxiety?

Surprisingly, the data showed that people who do not listen to music while working or studying have lower levels of anxiety, than those who do. However, we would prefer to deepen this analysis in order to get a better understanding of the types of genres people listen to while working or studying, since as shown in the above, there are genres that are associated with lower levels of anxiety.

6. What is the relationship between generations, listening to music, and the self reported level of anxiety, insomnia, and OCD?

From the data we were able to compile, we observed that young adults and adults suffer greater levels of anxiety and depression compared to teenagers. This analysis makes sense in the context that adults may have more stressors such as work, school, billings, healthcare, etc. It makes sense for teenagers to also suffer from high levels of anxiety, but having fewer responsiblities while at school-age. For further analysis, we would want to look at how music impacts the level of anxiety and depression while performing specific tasks. For instance: if someone listens to music while doing school work, what would their self-reported severity of mental illness be during those times. Doing this could provide more insight on how music impacts these mental illnesses.

6. What is the relationship between the BPM of music and the self reported level of mental health illness?

From our analysis, there seems to be no statistical relationship between BPM and self reported levels of mental illness. We found higher levels of anxiety and depression all at tempos across various genres, which also reflects our analysis in the previous question. We also found high levels of anxiety and depression in the sampled population, compared to insomnia and OCD, however we felt that our population was not large enough to make such a strong conclussion, and would prefer to collect data from a larger population for a better future analysis. If we want to concentrate on evaluating music's tempo, we could look at specific songs people prefer to listen to while experiencing higher levels of mental illness. From this, we could potentially see if there is a relationship between specific instances of high mental illness and music.

7. Is there any relationship between the favorite genres of the respondents and mental health conditions scale within different segments?

Our study led us to conclude:

   - Spotify is the most preferred choice accross the age groups with You tube being the next choice. Free music is preferred in both platforms.
   - Rock is ranked as favorite genre across the age groups. Pop is ranked as second favorite for teenage and young adults but adults prefer metal music. 
     Amongst teenagers K-pop is quickly catching up along with Metal. Adults have a diverese preference of music, with a slight preference to rock.
   - Rock, Pop and Metal again is the top choice by this micro segments. People who have Low mental health scale are listening to diversified range of music.
   
8. Does music help improve or worsen mental health conditions across different segments?

Music definitely helps across all segments to improve their mental health. A larger sample of data with respect to these respondents music's listening behaviors and their mental health scale will better help us to understand which mix of genres are helpful to improve their mental health condition. 

Our analysis and final outputs can be found in the PowerPoint presentation and Output folder respectively.
